// Guards against the class of bug that took the whole deployed app down: a
// committed module importing a named export that no shipped module provides, so
// ES module linking throws at load and nothing runs. `node --check` can't catch
// it (single file, no cross-module linking); this does. Runs as part of the
// normal `node --test` suite, so CI enforces it on every push/PR.
